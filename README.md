# KeysBazaar

**KeysBazaar** is a non-functional e-commerce website prototype designed to showcase the user interface and architecture of a modern online store.

## Project Overview

KeysBazaar simulates the core functionalities of a typical e-commerce platform, including product browsing, wishlisting, and cart management. While it is currently non-operational (lacking a backend connection or full database integration), it demonstrates how a real-world e-commerce solution can be structured using modern web development tools.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse a catalog of products by category.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and manage products in the cart.
- **User Profiles**: Different user roles are planned (Admin, Registered User, Guest).
- **Local Storage for Guests**: Non-registered users (guests) can save their cart and wishlist in local storage.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React.js for fast development and a reactive user interface.
  - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For crafting the structure, design, and interactivity of the platform.
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js for server-side logic (future implementation).
  - Currently designed to handle API requests, user management, and product data once integrated.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Finish catalog - Kosmo
- [ ] Fix getAllProducts (now the limit and offset dont work, I think I deleted it by accident)
